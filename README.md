# Introduction to Javascript
Javascript is a programming language created for web. If html is the language of web content, CSS is the language of web style, JS is the language of web applications that brings all of this together by adding interactivity and dynamic elements to websites. Back in 1995, Brandan Eich created a JavaScript. But today, JavaScript is use for all sorts of applications. From programming a robot with our an Arduino to writing a game script in Unity. In fact, even some code editors were built with JavaScript.

Javascript is a high-level interpreted programming language. Its an interpreted language which means that you don't have to compile the code before its executed. Its interpreted at run time. Its a high-level language - high abstraction from computer which makes it easy to use when compared to C Programming language which is a low level language as it gives control over memory management. Javascript is not Java

In this course you will learn the foundational building blocks of Javascript.
